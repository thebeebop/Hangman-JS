# Hangman-JS

This project was started as I wanted to get a better understanding of Javascript in general, and how Javascript is used to make an HTML doc interactive.

Key Takeaways: 

- I managed to create a fully functioning logic for the game.
- I got more practice using array methods such as: .includes, .filter etc. 
- I was able to get a better understanding of I/0s (Inputs & Outputs).
- Gained new experience working with the DOM, manipulating it to whatever/however I wanted it. 
- I was able to focus on and improve my CSS skills, specifically grid designs.
- It is fully responsove. It works on both mobile and desktop.
